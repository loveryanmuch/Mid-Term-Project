# Project goal 
We examined the current landscape of electric vehicles in Washington state, projected future trends, and explored the correlation between electric vehicle charging stations. Additionally, we considered the implications and necessary steps for establishing a new charging station in Washington state.

# Key Questions 
1) What is the current EV outlook in WA?
2) Growth patterns and types of EV over time?
3) Relations between areas of EV and charging stations

# Process
1) I discovered an API or dataset relevant to our topic.
2) We formulated key questions to further refine our focus.
3) We explored the data, cleaning it and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) based on our key questions.
4) We conducted a thorough analysis by employing data modeling techniques tailored to specific questions.
5) We designed a Tableau dashboard layout guided by our central questions.
6) We presented the information through visualizations such as maps and graphs.

# Results


# Challenges
1) It was difficult to decide on a topic and find APIs and datasets that fit the topic. While there's an abundance of APIs available, pinpointing the exact data we were seeking was no easy task.
2)
